# How to Get Data for This PoC

## Purpose

This folder contains example data files used in Elastic and Vega visualizations for this proof of concept (PoC).

## Components

### Example Graph Data

- `data.json`: Contains nodes and links in a format optimized for direct use with Vega scripts, requiring no additional transforms. Used by `directed-graph-tooltip.vg.json` for the simplest configuration.

### Raw Data as NDJSON

The following files provide raw data in [NDJSON](http://ndjson.org/) (newline-delimited JSON) format, suitable for ingestion into Elasticsearch or use in data processing pipelines:

- `asset-db.ndjson`: Raw asset database entries, one JSON object per line.
- `asset-status.ndjson`: Asset status records, each line is a separate JSON object.
- `input.ndjson`: Main input data for the PoC, generated by the `generate_data.js` script.

**Usage:**
- Upload these files directly to Elasticsearch using the Bulk API or Dev Tools.
- Each line represents a single document, enabling efficient streaming and processing.

**Example command to upload:**
```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" -XPOST "localhost:9200/input-logs/_bulk" --data-binary "@input.ndjson"
```

### Mocks for Elastic Queries as JSON

The following files provide mock responses for typical Elasticsearch queries. These are useful for local development, testing, or as reference examples:

- `asset-db-response.json`: Example response for an asset database query.
- `asset-dependencies-responce.json`: Mock response for asset dependencies queries.
- `asset-status-response.json`: Example response for asset status queries.
- `tmp.json`: A minimal version of asset dependencies, intended for debugging purposes.

**Usage:**
- These files simulate the JSON output you would receive from Elasticsearch after running the corresponding queries.
- Use them to test data processing scripts, front-end visualizations, or to understand the expected structure of Elasticsearch responses.
